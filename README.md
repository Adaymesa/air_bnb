#General comment and reflection

Although some individuals of the team were at the beginning wary of the way we should work together, and scared of the huge task ahead, people really went on to the task contributing with their technical and soft skills, and it was really amazing what we have accomplished in a week.

It took some time to organise ourselves in pairs, as it was quite complex to make a parallel path for the two pairs to work on, that did not happen until Tuesday mid-day.  However all the interaction within the group cemented the understanding of the team about the task, and built strong relationships.

We specifically asked Amy to become Chief Architect, and it has proven the right decision.  Maria has been instrumental in chasing complexitiy away with the relationship models, and she has been crowned datamapper queen by popular acclamation.  Aday has found errors that could have taken us months to debug, and saying in a nice way, are you sure you have added this require here, or that variable there? In his spare time he has teached HTML and CSS to Sergio and worked in the pub to serve pints to the Makers people.  Special mention goes to Sergio, who has not stopped chatting all week, (most of it in Spanish), and entertained with his sheeps the whole team, while in the background took an eye to the plumber fixing the pipe leak. That's what it's called multitasking adding value.

We have worked as a team and the result is there. We did not know how to work in an agile way, however we have shown the XP values and we put our strengths and skills together to make a great result.

The feeling of elation of seeing 50+ tests all passing green and with a 100% coverage is something amazing.  Try it at home.

Our controllers are fat and smelly? Oh well, Pull requests are always accepted, (now that we know how to resolve conflict merges :-)
